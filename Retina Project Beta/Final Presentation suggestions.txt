General overview of goals of the project
Structure of the project
	Pictures of photoreceptors, etc (pull all images from one source)
Slides on each individual cell & how we modeled
	Spread the graphs out more in our presentation
	Graphs should use fewer sig figs, also try to make the 2 graphs as similar as possible
	Have all axis line up.
	Images on sides, brief description on them
	Try to not have to need to go back a slide
	Dots should be very small, it should be square, not rectangular
	On slide with distribution, also show the bar graph and scatterplot
	Have slide that shows cones and rods on the same slide
On slides with few bullet points, visually separate out more
Put assumptions/limitations earlier in the presentation
On processing images slides, put images more side by side and more consistent in size
	Larger images!
	Include an optical illusion or two
	Processing images percent difference should correspond with the previous images
	Make sure aspect ratios are equal
Next steps/future section

General tips:
Graphs should have title explaining it, don't need paragraph
Titles should all line up
Other things should also line up
