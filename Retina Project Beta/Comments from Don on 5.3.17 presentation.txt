Compare our data/model with those of others

Put the bar chart of the eccentricity next to the circular graph

Use something other than Excel to display, make sure its circular

Use smaller dots in circular figure

Use a 3D plot, would be more revealing for the peak of the cones/rods.
I.e. 3D histogram

A list of references at the end (of paper)

Include a bunch of questions under a future section, questions we would've liked to answer

Take and reference pictures in perception psychology textbooks (i.e. Mathers) and compare our results with theirs

Give exact algorithm for the distribution once done

For edge finding algorithm, instead of lightness and darkness of edges, just directly change the colors onto the original image

Be able to vary these edge detection features based on distance from retina/ size of image

Explain how it could be useful in a vision course, connection to shortcut filters

Sfamuato - technique by artists in the Renaissance where paintings did not have edges 

In paper, have an intro paragraph with "why are we doing this?"
